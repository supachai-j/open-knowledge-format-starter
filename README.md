# open-knowledge-format-starter

A ready-to-fork starter for building an **AI-maintained knowledge base** on the
**Open Knowledge Format (OKF) v0.1** (Google Cloud, 2026-06-12) — a directory of
Markdown files with YAML frontmatter that humans and AI agents can author, exchange,
and consume without translation.

> OKF formalizes Andrej Karpathy's "LLM-wiki" pattern into a portable, vendor-neutral spec.
> Instead of re-retrieving raw chunks on every query (classic RAG), an agent continuously
> synthesizes sources into curated, cross-linked Markdown that loads straight into context.

## What's in here

```text
AGENTS.md            ← schema + agent operating rules (READ FIRST)
.claude/skills/okf/  ← Claude Code skill that drives ingest/query/lint/validate
raw/                 ← Layer 1: immutable source materials (read-only for the agent)
wiki/                ← Layer 2: the OKF bundle (agent-maintained concepts)
  index.md           ← reserved: progressive-disclosure catalog
  log.md             ← reserved: append-only change log
  tables/ datasets/ metrics/ playbooks/ references/   ← example concepts (replace with yours)
  viz.html           ← generated single-file graph viewer (libs inlined; air-gap)
tools/               ← validate · viz (air-gap) · index (BM25) · embed (Ollama) · search (hybrid RRF) · lease (concurrency)
  vendor/            ← Cytoscape + marked (MIT), inlined into viz.html for offline use
server/              ← okf_mcp_server.py — self-hostable MCP access layer for agents
deploy/              ← docker-compose (gitea + MCP + TLS proxy) for on-prem self-hosting

```

## Quickstart

```bash
git clone https://github.com/supachai-j/open-knowledge-format-starter.git
cd open-knowledge-format-starter
python3 tools/okf-validate.py          # → ✓ CONFORMANT with OKF v0.1
python3 tools/okf-viz.py               # → writes wiki/viz.html, open it in any browser
```

1. Read **[AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md)** — governs how concepts are structured and how the agent behaves.
2. Browse the bundle from **[wiki/index.md](wiki/index.md)**.
3. Add knowledge: drop a source in `raw/`, then run the supervised **INGEST** workflow.
4. New concepts start from **[tools/concept-template.md](tools/concept-template.md)**.

## Using the skill (Claude Code)

This repo ships a skill at `.claude/skills/okf/`. Open the repo in Claude Code and just state intent:

| You say | The agent does |
| :--- | :--- |
| "ingest raw/notes.pdf into the wiki" | Extracts 5–15 claims, shows them for approval, then writes concepts + updates `index.md`/`log.md` |
| "what does the wiki say about WAU?" | Reads the index, opens concepts, answers with Concept-ID citations |
| "create an OKF concept for the Sessions table" | Scaffolds a conformant concept from the template |
| "validate the bundle" | Runs `tools/okf-validate.py` and reports |

Any agent that reads `AGENTS.md` (e.g. via `CLAUDE.md`/`GEMINI.md`) can follow the same procedures.

## Enterprise / self-hosted (cross-session, cross-team)

Run the same bundle on-prem as shared, internal knowledge for every session and agent team —
no SaaS, air-gap friendly. **Git is the source of truth; an internal MCP server is the access layer.**
Reads are instant; writes are PR-gated (audit + review + CI). Full architecture, security model,
concurrency options, and deploy steps: **[docs/ENTERPRISE.md](docs/ENTERPRISE.md)**.

```bash
# Local / dev (stdio, no network):
python3 tools/okf-index.py build            # build the BM25 search index
python3 server/okf_mcp_server.py            # serve the bundle over MCP (stdio)

# Optional semantic upgrade (on-prem, no external API) — search auto-falls back to BM25 if absent:
ollama pull nomic-embed-text
python3 tools/okf-embed.py build            # embeddings → wiki/.okf-embed.json
python3 tools/okf-search.py "how is WAU defined"   # hybrid BM25 + semantic (RRF)

# Fully offline viewer (libs inlined, no CDN):
python3 tools/okf-viz.py                    # wiki/viz.html — single self-contained file

# On-prem stack (internal git + MCP + TLS/auth proxy):
cd deploy && cp .env.example .env && docker compose up -d
```

Agents connect to one internal MCP endpoint and get `okf_search`, `okf_get_concept`,
`okf_list_concepts`, `okf_read_index`, and `okf_propose_change` (branch + PR, never direct to `main`).
For high write-throughput teams, set `OKF_WRITE_MODE=lease` to switch to advisory leases
(`okf_acquire_lease` / `okf_commit_concept` / `okf_release_lease`) — short-TTL, token-verified,
auto-expiring so a crashed agent never deadlocks a concept.

## Conformance (OKF v0.1)

- Every non-reserved `.md` in `wiki/` has parseable YAML frontmatter with a non-empty `type`.
- `index.md` / `log.md` follow their reserved structure.
- Concept ID = path within `wiki/` minus `.md` (e.g. `tables/orders.md` → `tables/orders`).
- Consumers tolerate unknown keys, unknown `type` values, missing optional fields, and broken links.

## Background & caveats

See [`research/okf-best-practice-implementation-report.md`](research/okf-best-practice-implementation-report.md)
for the sourced best-practice guide, [`research/okf-mindmap.json`](research/okf-mindmap.json) for the concept map,
and [`research/knowledge-catalog-findings.md`](research/knowledge-catalog-findings.md) for the gap analysis against
Google's official reference implementation (which shaped the conventions used here).

> OKF is **v0.1** (days old at scaffold time). Versioning is `<major>.<minor>`; expect changes.
> The normative spec requires only the `type` field — most "best practices" here come from the
> surrounding LLM-wiki community, not the spec itself. Patterns like confidence-decay and hybrid
> search are optional add-ons, not part of v0.1.
